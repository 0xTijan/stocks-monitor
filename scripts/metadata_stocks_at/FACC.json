Today, the company is represented on almost all major platforms and in a wide variety of aircraft sectors. The product portfolio ranges from structural components on fuselages and wings to engine components and complete passenger cabins for commercial aircraft and business jets. FACC sees further potential in attractive new business fields like urban air mobility and space. Drone technologies will open up the airspace directly above the ground for broad mobility applications. At the same time, we are witnessing the merging of aviation and space through the privatization of aerospace.
